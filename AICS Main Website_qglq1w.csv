  - An HTTP request smuggling vulnerability exists in Tomcat due to mishandling Transfer-Encoding headers
    behind a reverse proxy. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via crafted HTTP requests,
    to cause unintended HTTP requests to reach the back-end. (CVE-2019-17569)

  - An HTTP request smuggling vulnerability exists in Tomcat due to bad end-of-line (EOL) parsing that allowed
    some invalid HTTP headers to be parsed as valid. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via
    crafted HTTP requests, to cause unintended HTTP requests to reach the back-end. (CVE-2020-1935)

  - An arbitrary file read vulnerability exists in Tomcat's Apache JServ Protocol (AJP) due to an
    implementation defect. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this to access files which, under
    normal conditions, would be restricted. If the Tomcat instance supports file uploads, the vulnerability
    could also be leveraged to achieve remote code execution. (CVE-2020-1938)

  - When recycling various internal objects, including the request and the response, prior to re-use by the

  - Tomcat did not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers. A specially crafted, invalid trailer header could
